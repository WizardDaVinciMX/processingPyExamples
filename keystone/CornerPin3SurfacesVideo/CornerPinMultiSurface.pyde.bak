"""
*
 * This is a simple example of how to use the Keystone library.
 *
 * To use this example in the real world, you need a projector
 * and a surface you want to project your Processing sketch onto.
 *
 * Simply drag the corners of the CornerPinSurface so that they
 * match the physical surface's corners. The result will be an
 * undistorted projection, regardless of projector position or 
 * orientation.
 *
 * You can also create more than one Surface object, and project
 * onto multiple flat surfaces using a single projector.
 *
 * This extra flexbility can comes at the sacrifice of more or 
 * less pixel resolution, depending on your projector and how
 * many surfaces you want to map.
